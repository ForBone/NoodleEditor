# Noodle Editor
**This editor does not have mapping features! For mapping please use [ChroMapper](https://github.com/Caeden117/ChroMapper)!**

## The Editor
Noodle Editor is an editor that helps you create [modcharts](https://github.com/Aeroluna/Heck).

## Using
To use the editor you go to [releases](https://github.com/ForBone/NoodleEditor/releases/) and download the latest release!
To launch the editor you need locate the NoodleEditor.exe and open it, now you are ready to go make modcharts!

## About
I started this project on June 07, 2024 with a mindset to create an easy to use editor for myself to make modcharts. Later down the road I decided to make this a project to bring out to the world to use. I made it open source so people could contribute and make this editor alot better because I am not perfect at creating one!

## Contributing
To contribute to this project you have to fork this repository. Then clone it and open the project in unity hub with unity version 2022.3.25f1. You're fully welcome to make pull requests with changes, we might add it to the editor!
